This project provide a method to detect skull in a MR image.

It can not find the skull in a pixel-stage, but can determine whether the MR image has a skull.

The skull_detector needs a T1(T2 is also OK) modality and the brain extraction result from  T1.

By the way, the brain extraction result can be created by my project--brain_extraction_with_ants(You can find that project in my repositories).
